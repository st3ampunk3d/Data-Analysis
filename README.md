# Overview
Data analysis is a subject that I've always been interested in. It is a skill that is becoming more and more sought after.
This poject is my first attempt at data analysis using Pandas and Python. In my research Pandas was one of the most commonly used and suggested packages for data analysis.
The goal was to get my toes wet and become familiar with the package and its capabilities.

I chose a dataset from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshuu/dog-breeds) that contained information for 117 dog breeds.

The dataset included the following information about each breed:
* Breed Name
* Country of Origin
* Fur color(s)
* Eye color(s)
* Height
* Life expectancy
* Common Character traits
* Common health problems

# Data Analysis Results

##Questions that I answered using thos dataset:
1. What is the least common color of fur for a dog to have?
    - The least common color of fur is Black with white markings.
    - The most common color of fur is solid black
2. Which dog breed can live the longest?
    - The breed with the longest life expectancy is the Chihuahua (20 years).
    - The breed with the shortest life expectancy is the Irish Wolfhound (6 years)
3. What is the smallest breed?
    - The smallest dog breed is the dachshund (5 inches tall).
    - The largest dog breed is the Irish Woljound (35 inchest tall)
4. What is the most common health issue that dogs have?
    - The data shows that eye problems are the most common.
5. What is the most common character trait for a dog to have?
    - The data shows that intelligence is the most common character trait for dogs.
6. Which country "invented" the most breeds?
    - The majorit of breeds listed in the dataset originated in England.


# Development Environment
This project was written in Python
I used the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to handle the data analysis and graphing.

Visual Studio Code and the standard Python extension were used to write and debug the code.

# Useful Websites

* [Python](http://python.org)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

# Future Work

* I feel that some of the answers may give an incomplete picture. I might expand the results to show averages instead of just the minimums and maximums.
* The user interface isn't very appealing. It seemed strange to me to mix the graphical plots with the console based questions and answers. I would like
  to see this project move to a standalone GUI that is easier to navigate and manipulate.
